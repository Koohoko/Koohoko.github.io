Yesterday, a spatial epidemiology workshop was held in Zhongshan and I fortunately got a chance to join them. Professor Hu from Queensland Unioversity of Technology had brought us an overview of traditional spatial methods for studying public health problems. 

Four tools were introduced by Prof. Hu, they are:
- Arc Map
- GeoDa
- SaTScan
- WinBUGS

I have konwn the first two software before, and SaTScan was also easy. But for WinBUGS, I just wish I could know it earlier. It is a tool for developing Bayesiam spatial Poisson models for areal data. Although I had successfully rebuilt the model during the workshop, I could not fully understand the statistical processing in it due to my poor math. My next task shall be working on the Baysesian statistics and the MCMC.
