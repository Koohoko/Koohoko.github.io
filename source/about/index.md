My name is Haogao Gu (顾豪高), I am currently a final-year undergraduate student majoring in public health at Sun Yat-sen University, China, and will be graduating this June.

I have been exploring the relationships between meteorological factors and the risk for human infection with avian influenza as well as dengue fever during my research projects since last year.

Inspired by some novel studies in terms of utilizing big data to solve public health problems, e.g., [adapting social media as a sensor of air quality and public response](http://www.jmir.org/2015/1/e22/); [predicting dengue fever with mobile phone data](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/38/11887.full), recently I am particularly interested in trying something new.
