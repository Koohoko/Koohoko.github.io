# Bayesian inference in integrative structural biology


- Goal: Molecular mechanism, understand, modulate, evolution, design.
- Experimental data: X-ray crystallography, NMR, Cryo-EM, SAXS, FRET, HDX-MS, mutagenesis, cross-linking, etc.
- In-silico modeling: 
  - Co-evolution between residues
- Molecular dynamics: 
  - Simulate the motion of atoms

- Integrative structural biology:
  - Combine multiple experimental data
  - Representation of the protein structure
    - Atomic 
    - Residue level
    - Protein level
  - **Translates the experimental data into a representation**
  - Sampling the conformational space
  - Analysis of the ensemble of structures
