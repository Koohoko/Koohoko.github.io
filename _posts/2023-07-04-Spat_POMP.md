[This dissertation](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/169706) is the PhD thesis from Kidus Asfaw. Here I recorded some notes when I read it. There is also a preprint paper of this dissertation: [Partially observed Markov processes with spatial structure via the R package spatPomp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01157).

Basically in this thesis, Kidus Asfaw introduced the SpatPomp model and its associated package. He also described several algorithms for calibrating the parameters e.g. GIRF, UBF, ABF, EnKF etc. in details in the paper. While I was studying this paper, I also found that there maybe some other useful (maybe better in some cases?) algorithms recently developed, e.g. [IBPF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03837) (This was mentioned in the preprint paper but not in the thesis). There is also [slides](https://ionides.github.io/talks/mfo23.pdf) online about IBPF.

In the below section, I will take some notes which I think would be helpful to me from the thesis and paper.
