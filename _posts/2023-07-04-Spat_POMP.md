[This dissertation](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/169706) is the PhD thesis from Kidus Asfaw. Here I recorded some notes when I read it. There is also a preprint paper of this dissertation: [Partially observed Markov processes with spatial structure via the R package spatPomp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01157).
