We decide to read the book [*Molecular Evolution: A Statistical Approach*](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/MESA/) by Ziheng Yang, to gether on a weekly basis. 

# Models of nucleotide substitution

- We define $p$ distance as thr proportion of sites that differ between two sequences.
- The true evolutionary distance $d$ is the expected number of substitutions per site between two sequences.
- CTMC (Continuous Time Markov Chain): four nucleotides are *states* of the chain, it will reach to *steady state* with a *stationary distribution*, via a *substitution rate matrix*.

## Markov models of nucleotide substitution and distance estimation

### The JC69 model

- Jukes-Cantor 1969 model.
- The substitution rate matrix $Q$ is
  $$
  Q = \begin{pmatrix}
  -3\lambda & \lambda & \lambda & \lambda \\
  \lambda & -3\lambda & \lambda & \lambda \\
  \lambda & \lambda & -3\lambda & \lambda \\
  \lambda & \lambda & \lambda & -3\lambda
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$
- The matrix of transition probability: $P(t) = e^{Qt}$. This is using Kolmogorov forward equation, where $\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = QP(t)$.
- We then use Taylor expansion to get $P(t) = I + Qt + \frac{Q^2t^2}{2!} + \cdots$.

    - [Taylor polynomial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4)
- Chapmanâ€“Kolmogorov equation: $P_ij(t+s) = \sum_k P_ik(t)P_kj(s)$. This account for the multiple (hidden) states between $i$ and $j$.
- As $d=3\lambda t$, then $p(d) = 3p_1(t)=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{3}{4}e^{-4\lambda t}=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{3}{4}e^{-4d/3}$, then $\hat{d}=-\frac{3}{4}log(1-\frac{4}{3}\hat{p})$.

### The K80 model

- Kimura 1980 model.
- Transitions: pyrimidine (T $\leftrightarrow$ C), purine (A $\leftrightarrow$ G).
- Transversion: (T, C $\leftrightarrow$ A, G).
- $d = (\alpha + 2\beta)t$.
- $\kappa = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}$.
- $E(S) = p_1(t)$.
- $E(V) = 2p_2(t)$.
- $\hat{d} = -\frac{1}{2} \log(1 - 2S - V) - \frac{1}{4} \log(1 - 2V)$.

### HKY85, F84, TN93, etc.

#### TN93

- Tamura-Nei 1993 model.
- 7 parameters and 6 free parameters.
- $\pi_Y = \pi_T + \pi_C$ and $\pi_R = \pi_A + \pi_G$.
- $P(t)$ can be solved using spectral decomposition of $Q$.
  - $Q = U \Lambda U^{-1}$.
  - $\Lambda = \text{diag}\lbrace \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \lambda_4 \rbrace$.
  - $P(t) = U e^{\Lambda t} U^{-1} = U \text{diag}\lbrace e^{\lambda_1 t}, e^{\lambda_2 t}, e^{\lambda_3 t}, e^{\lambda_4 t} \rbrace U^{-1}$.

- $\lambda = -\sum_i \pi_i q_{ii} = 2\pi_T \pi_C \alpha_1 + 2\pi_A \pi_G \alpha_2 + 2\pi_Y \pi_R \beta$.
- $d = \lambda t$.
- Using $E(S_1), E(S_2), E(V)$ to estimate $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \beta$.
- $\hat{d}$ can be represented as a function of nucleotide frequencies and $E(S_1), E(S_2), E(V)$.

#### HKY85 and F84

- 6 parameters and 5 free parameters.

- Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano 1985 model.
  - Interesting fact: it should be called HKY84, misnamed in *Yang 1994*.
  - Setting $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha$ or $\kappa_1 = \kappa_2 = \kappa$ in TN93 model.
- Felsenstein 1984 model.
  - Setting $\alpha_1 = (1+\kappa/\pi_Y)\beta$ and $\alpha_2 = (1+\kappa/\pi_R)\beta$ in TN93 model.
  - It is easier to derive a distance formula for F84 than for HKY85.
- Felsenstein 1981 model.
  - Setting $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \beta$ in TN93 model.
  - A distance formula was derived by *Tajima and Nei (1982)*.
    - On a side note, *Tajima and Nei (1984)* is a classic paper on nucleotide diversity.

### The transition/transversion rate ratio

- Three definitions:
  - $E(S)/E(V) = p_1(t)/2p_2(t)$ under the K80 model (the uncorrected method).
  - $\kappa = \alpha/\beta$ under the K80 model (corrected).
  - $R = \alpha/2\beta$ under the K80 model (corredted). It's called *average transition/transversion ratio*. More generally, $R = \frac{\pi_T q_{TC} + \pi_C q_{CT} + \pi_A q_{AG} + \pi_G q_{GA}}{\pi_T q_{TA} + \pi_T q_{TG} + \pi_C q_{CA} + \pi_C q_{CG} + \pi_A q_{AT} + \pi_A q_{AC} + \pi_G q_{GT} + \pi_G q_{GC}}$ under UNREST.

## Variable substitution rates among sites

- Assuming the rate $r$ for any site is drawn from a gamma distribution.
- Models with *Gamma distance* denoted by a suffix '$+\Gamma$'.
- Gamma distribution have two parameters: shape $\alpha$ and scale $\beta$. The mean is $\alpha/\beta$, and the variance is $\alpha/\beta^2$. You can also consider them as number of Poisson process events of $\alpha$ with rate $1/\beta$.
- Note that the gamma distribution here sets $\alpha = \beta$ so that the mean equals to $1$.
- If a site has a rate $r$, the distance between sequences becomes $d = r t$.
- $p(d\cdot r)$ can be calculated by integrating the gamma distribution.
- For JC69 model, $p = \int_0^\infty \left( \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} e^{-4d \cdot r / 3} \right) g(r) \, dr 
= \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} \left( 1 + \frac{4d}{3\beta} \right)^{-\alpha}$.
- Similarly, one can derive a gamma distance under virtually every model for which a one-rate distance formula is available.
- It is well known that ignoring rate variation among sites leads to underestimation of both the sequence distance and the transition/transversion rate ratio.

## Maximum likelihood estimation of distance

- The likelihood function is $L(\theta; X) = f(X|\theta)$.
- MLE is the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the likelihood function.
- Probability vs. Likelihood:
  - Likelihood $\ne$ Probability: Likelihood does not sum to 1, unlike probability.
  - Interpretation: Probability is understood by area under the curve, while likelihood is compared at specific points.
  - Reparametrization: Likelihood is invariant under monotonic transformations, so MLEs remain unchanged.
  - Nonlinear Effects: Nonlinear transformations alter probability density shapes, potentially changing modality.

### The JC69 model

- The single parameter is the distance $d = 3\lambda t$. The data are two aligned sequences, each $n$ sites long, with $x$ differences.
- $p = 3p_1(t) = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} e^{-4d/3}$.
- The likelihood function is $L(d; X) = {n\choose x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$.
- After reparametrization: $L(d; X) = (\frac{1}{4}p_1)^x (\frac{1}{4}p_0)^{n-x}$. (I think $\frac{1}{4}$ can be further dropped.)
- Two approaches to estimate confidence intervals:
  - Normal approximation: $\hat{d} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{var({d})}$.
  - Likelihood interval, based on likelihood ratio test: $\frac{1}{2}\chi^2_{1, 5\%} = 3.841/2 = 1.921$.

### The K80 model

- $L(d, \kappa; n_S, n_V) = \left( \frac{p_0}{4} \right)^{(n - n_S - n_V)} \times \left( \frac{p_1}{4} \right)^{n_S}  \times \left( \frac{p_2}{4} \right)^{n_V}.$
- $\frac{1}{2}\chi^2_{2, 5\%} = 5.991/2 = 2.995$.

### Likelihood ratio test of substitution models

- For model comparison, if two models are **nested**, then the likelihood ratio test can be used.

### Profile and integrated likelihood

- The above approaches, estimating one parameter while ignoring the other, are called *relative likelihood*, *pseudo likelihood* or *estimated likelihood*.
- A more respective approach is *profile likelihood*.
  - $\ell(d) = \ell(d, \hat{\kappa}_d)$, where $\hat{\kappa}_d$ is the MLE of $\kappa$ for the given $d$.
  - This is a pragmatic approach that most often leads to reasonable answers.
- *Integrated likelihood* or *marginal likelihood* is the likelihood of the data given the model, averaged over the parameter space.
  - It is possible to use a improper prior, such as a uniform distribution, to calculate the marginal likelihood.
  - Integrated likelihood is always smaller than the profile likelihood.

## Markov chains and distance estimation under general models

### Distance under the unrestricted (UNREST) model

- Unlike the **GTR model**, UNREST does not assume time-reversibility.
- Here we consider a strand-symmetry model, where $q_{TC} = q_{AG}$.
- Equilibrium nucleotide frequencies $\{\pi_T, \pi_C, \pi_A, \pi_G\}$ perhaps by coincidence, can be estimated analytically.

1. **Identifiability Issues and Distance Calculation**
   - The **model can, in theory, identify the root** of a two-sequence tree.
   - However, **estimating both $t_1$ and $t_2$ separately** leads to **high correlation** between estimates.
   - The model has **13 parameters**:  
     - **11 rate parameters** in $Q$.
     - **2 branch lengths** $t_1, t_2$.
   - **Challenges:**
     - No analytical solution for MLEs.
     - Complex eigenvalues make numerical estimation difficult.
     - Many datasets do not provide enough information to estimate so many parameters.
   - **Conclusion:**  
     - Although $t_1$ and $t_2$ are **identifiable**, their estimates are **highly correlated**.
     - The UNREST model **is not recommended for distance calculations**.

### Distance under the general time-reversible model
1. **Time-Reversibility in Markov Chains**
   - A Markov chain is **time-reversible** if:
     $$
     \pi_i q_{ij} = \pi_j q_{ji}, \quad \text{for all } i \neq j.
     $$
     This condition is known as **detailed balance**.
   - **Reversibility is a mathematical convenience**, not necessarily a biological property.
   - Models such as **JC69, K80, F84, HKY85, and TN93** are all **time-reversible**.

2. **Rate Matrix for GTR Model**
   - The **GTR (General Time-Reversible) model** is defined using the rate matrix:
     $$
     Q = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
     \cdot & a\pi_C & b\pi_A & c\pi_G \\
     a\pi_T & \cdot & d\pi_A & e\pi_G \\
     b\pi_T & d\pi_C & \cdot & f\pi_G \\
     c\pi_T & e\pi_C & f\pi_A & \cdot
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$
     - It has **nine free parameters** (six substitution rates + three equilibrium frequencies).

3. **Simplification of Likelihood Computation**
   - Reversibility simplifies likelihood computation:
     $$
     f_{ij}(t_1, t_2) = \sum_k \pi_k p_{ki}(t_1) p_{kj}(t_2) = \pi_i p_{ij}(t_1 + t_2).
     $$
     - The second equality follows from **reversibility**.
     - The third equality follows from the **Chapman-Kolmogorov theorem**.
     - This allows estimation of **total branch length** instead of individual times.

4. **Log-Likelihood Formulation**
   - The log-likelihood function is:
     $$
     \ell(t, a, b, c, d, e, f, \pi_T, \pi_C, \pi_A) = \sum_i \sum_j n_{ij} \log(\pi_i p_{ij}(t)).
     $$
   - After scaling, the **distance** is defined as:
     $$
     d = -t \sum_i \pi_i q_{ii} = t.
     $$

- Note that distance formulae are not MLEs.
  - Observed base frequencies are not MLEs of the base frequency parameters.
  - All 16 site patterns have distinct probabilities in the likelihood function but are collapsed in distance formulae (e.g., TT, CC, AA, GG).
  - Despite this simplification, distance formulae still approximate MLEs well.
- Pairwise comparisons **sum up branch lengths** but may **overestimate distances**.
- Likelihood-based methods (**ML, Bayesian**) provide **better phylogenetic estimates**.
