## Developing the SIR Model
### Backgrounds
#### Solving differential equations using ode() in R

#### Competing Hazards in Compartmental Models
Basically $\frac{a}{a+b+c}$:

#### SIR Model with a Constant Force of Infection
$\lambda$: force of infection


#### SIR Model with a Dynamic Force of Infection
  <img src="/files/2023-04-11-IDM/Screenshot%202023-04-14%20at%2011.55.02.webp" width="500"/>

$\lambda = \beta\frac{I}{N}$
$\beta$ is the infection rate, which may be represented as $p \times c$, where $p$ is the chance of getting infection per contact, and $c$ is the number of contacts made per day.

There is a [good post](https://parasiteecology.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/density-dependent-vs-frequency-dependent-disease-transmission/) on difference between Density-dependent and Frequency-dependent Disease Transmission ($\beta\frac{I}{N}$ and $\beta{I}$).

#### $R_0$ and $R_{eff}$

$R_{eff} = R_0\frac{S}{N}$

$$
\lambda=\beta{\frac{I}{N}} \\
\frac{dS}{dt}=b(S+I+R)-\mu{S}-\lambda{S}\\
\frac{dI}{dt}=\lambda{S}-\mu{I}-\gamma{I}\\
\frac{dR}{dt}=\gamma{I}-\mu{R}

#### A simple model for vaccination
In this simple model, $p$ of the population is immunized.

## Building on the SIR Model
### Stochastic and Deterministic Models
All the above models are Deterministic Models. We could use Gillespie algorithm to model stochastic SIR model.

### Age-structured model 
We can apply contact matrix as a parameter to model the transmission between different age groups.
```r
# INPUT
# Initial state values for a naive population (everyone is susceptible except for 1 index case),
# where the total population size N is (approximately) 1 million, 20% of this are children and 15% are elderly

                          S2 = 650000,   # 100%-20%-15% of the population are adults - all susceptible
                          S3 = 150000,   # 15% of the population are elderly - all susceptible
                          I1 = 1,        # the outbreak starts with 1 infected person (can be of either age) 
                          I2 = 0,

                          R3 = 0)

# Set up an empty contact matrix with rows for each age group and columns for each age group
contact_matrix <- matrix(0,nrow=3,ncol=3)
# Fill in the contract matrix
contact_matrix[1,1] = 7     # daily number of contacts that children make with each other
contact_matrix[1,2] = 5     # daily number of contacts that children make with adults
contact_matrix[1,3] = 1     # daily number of contacts that children make with the elderly
contact_matrix[2,1] = 2     # daily number of contacts that adults make with children
contact_matrix[2,2] = 9     # daily number of contacts that adults make with each other
contact_matrix[2,3] = 1     # daily number of contacts that adults make with the elderly

### Modelling Vector-Borne Diseases
The structure of a VBD model is shown below:

$a$ is the biting rate of mosquitoes.
$b$ is the probability of infection following a bite.

Vectorial Capacity: The number of secondary cases arising per day from a single infected case in a totally susceptible human population.

- What is $p^n$?
$p$ is the probability of the vector surviving through one day and $n$ is the average duration of the extrinsic incubation period in days, so $p^n$ is the probability of the vector surviving through the extrinsic incubation period.
