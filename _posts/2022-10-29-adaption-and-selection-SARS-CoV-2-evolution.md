The paper titled [Contributions of adaptation and purifying selection to SARS-CoV-2 evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.22.504731v1) analysed the evolutionary patterns of SARS-CoV-2 using a large dataset of its genomic sequences. The author estimate rates of evolution (synoymous and non-synonymous mutations) using consensus sequences within clades. The results suggest that: **1,** synoymous mutation rates are similar between variants; **2,** non-synonymous rates slowed down in 2021 and 2022; **3,** the overall non-synonymous rate is higher than the within-clade non-synonymous rate, indicating adaptive evolution (in addition to typical transmission chinas); **4,** the higher non-synonymous mutation rates suggest that there is a overall positive selection, but short-time (a few weeks) purifying selection in some ORFs were also identified by the author.

Also I found the modelling methods in this paper is interesting.
