This post focuses on several papers using **non-structured** coalescent methods to infer transmission history from genomic data. 


# [Genomic Infectious Disease Epidemiology in Partially Sampled and Ongoing Outbreaks](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/34/4/997/2919386?login=true) by *Xavier Didelot et al.* on Molecular Biology and Evolution, 2017.

Transphylo (R package) was introduced in this paper.


# [Bayesian reconstruction of transmission within outbreaks using genomic variants](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006117) by *Nicola De Maio et al.* on PLOS Computational Biology, 2018.
