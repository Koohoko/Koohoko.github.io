Sophie mentioned a method called *Multidimensional scaling* to study antibody response to multiple HA proteins (e.g. Fig 3 of this paper: [Influenza Virus Infection Induces a Narrow Antibody Response in Children but a Broad Recall Response in Adults](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6974575/#!po=0.649351). I hereby marked down some important notes when studying this method.
