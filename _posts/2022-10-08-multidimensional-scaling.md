Sophie mentioned a method called *Multidimensional scaling* to study antibody response to multiple HA proteins (e.g. Fig 4 & 5 of this paper: [Defining the antibody cross-reactome directed against the influenza virus surface glycoproteins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28192418/). I hereby marked down some important notes when studying this method. 

## Background
Protective humoral immune responses to influenza virus are usually associated with antibodies to its surface glycoproteins hemag-glutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and generally includes four types of antibodies:
1. antibodies that exhibit hemag-glutination-inhibition (HI) activity;
2. NA-inhibition-activate antibodies;
3. HA-stalk-reactive antibodies;
4. antibodies that confer protection in vivo without showing neutralizing activity in vitro.

  "Here we analyzed the titers and breadth of antibodies to the influenza virus surface glycoproteins HA and NA induced by infection in three animal models and in humans, as well as the prevalence of cross-reactive antibodies in the general human population"
