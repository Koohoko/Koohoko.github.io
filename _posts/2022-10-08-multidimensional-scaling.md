Sophie mentioned a method called *Multidimensional scaling* to study antibody response to multiple HA proteins (e.g. Fig 4 & 5 of this paper: [Defining the antibody cross-reactome directed against the influenza virus surface glycoproteins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28192418/). I hereby marked down some important notes when studying this method.
