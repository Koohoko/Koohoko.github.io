## [Bayesian inference of reassortment networks reveals fitness benefits of reassortment in human influenza viruses](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1918304117) by Muller et al. on PNAS, 2020.




## [Joint Inference of Migration and Reassortment Patterns for Viruses with Segmented Genomes](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/1/msab342/6454099) by *Ugnė Stolz, Tanja Stadler, Nicola F Müller, and Timothy G Vaughan* on Molecular Biology and Evolution, 2021.

- This paper is about Structured Coalescent with Reassortment (SCORE).
- This work was built upon the previous work of [Müller et al. 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1918304117), which is the unstructured coalescent with reassortment model.
- Reassortment is well known in influenza viruses. Reassortment events have clear boundaries in the genome, in comparison to recombination.
- **Intuitively**, migration and reassortment are closely related, as reassortment can only occur when two different strains co-infect the same host.
