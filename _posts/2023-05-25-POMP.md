This post records the notes when I learnt the [Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/) by Aaron A. King, Edward L. Ionides, Jesse Wheeler. 

I learn this for better understanding of the details of IDM, and more practically, how to implement IDM using a Bayesian framework using R.

### What makes epidemiological inference hard? 
#### Epidemiological and Ecological Dynamics
Ecological systems are complex, open, nonlinear and nonstationary. It is useful to model them as stochastic models. For any observable phenomenon, multiple competing explanations are possible. Time series are particularly useful sources of data.
#### Obstacles to inference
Obstacles for ecological modeling and inference via nonlinear mechanistic models enumerated by Bjørnstad and Grenfell (2001)
1. Combining measurement noise and process noise.
2. Including covariates in mechanistically plausible ways.
3. Using continuous-time models.
4. Modeling and estimating interactions in coupled systems. 
5. Dealing with unobserved variables.
6. Modeling spatial-temporal dynamics.

### Partially observed Markov processes model
Also called hidden Markov model or state space model.
#### Mathematical definition
- Data $y^*_1,...,y^*_N$ collected at times $t_1<...<t_N$ are modeled as noisy, incomplete, and indirect *observations of a Markov process* $\{X(t), t ≥ t_0\}$.
- $\{X(t)\}$ is Markov if the history of the process, $\{X(s), s ≤ t\}$, is uninformative about the future of the process, $\{X(s), s ≥ t\}$, given the current value of the process, $X(t)$.
- In other words, Markov property holds if everything important for the dynamics of the system at $X_t$, we don't need to remember anything in the history to talk about the future process. 
- An important special case: any system of differential equations $dx/dt = f(x)$ is Markovian.

> A model is a data generating process: data are the realization of some stochastic process, and a model is to describe the stochastic process.
