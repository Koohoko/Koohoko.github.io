This is the first blog of this website. 

The page is hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com) and was powered by [Jerkll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
When building this website, some reference pages were essential and were listed below:
  - [https://rayeren.github.io/](https://rayeren.github.io/)
  - [https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/)
  - [https://academicpages.github.io](https://academicpages.github.io)

About 6 years ago, I also developed a github pages blog using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-tw/). I think Hexo is generally simpler than Jerkll in terms of blogging, but Jerkll can be more versatile. For a customized website, some level of knowledge about HTML and CSS is needed.
