This post records the notes when I learnt the [Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/) by Aaron A. King, Edward L. Ionides, Jesse Wheeler. 

I learn this for better understanding of the details of IDM, and more practically, how to implement IDM using a Bayesian framework using R.
