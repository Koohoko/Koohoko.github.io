<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at School of Public Health, the University of Hong Kong as a postdoctoral fellow now. My research interest has been in the evolution and epidemiology of virus infections, viral sequence features and virus-host interactions. This has led to various research studies focusing on influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 which are highly transmissible pathogens among human population. I am good at bioinformatic and statistical analysis of viral sequencing data, and my research has provided novel insights on both basic virology and applied science on containing virus transmission. My contribution to this field is reflected in my publication record of >20 peer-reviewed papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sie-ZJkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
